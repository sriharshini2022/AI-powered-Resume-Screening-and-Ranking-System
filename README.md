Project Overview üöÄ
The AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze resumes and match them to job descriptions. By using pre-trained models, it ranks resumes based on relevance and qualifications. This system aims to reduce manual effort, eliminate bias, and speed up the hiring process for HR professionals.

Key Features:
AI-powered ranking: Automatically ranks resumes according to the relevance to the job description.
Resume parsing: Extracts key details from resumes including skills, education, experience, and contact information.
Job description matching: Compares resume content with job requirements and ranks based on match score.
Data visualization: Presents results in an easy-to-understand format (e.g., score, ranking).
Optimized for HR workflows: Supports easy integration into HR management systems.
Features üéâ
Automated Resume Screening: The system automatically processes resumes and categorizes them based on relevance.
Ranking Algorithm: Ranks resumes in descending order of match to the job description.
Customizable: Allows for customizable scoring criteria, such as skills, experience, or education.
AI-Powered Suggestions: Recommends top candidates based on analysis of resumes and job descriptions.
Efficiency Boost: Reduces time and effort spent on manual resume evaluation.
Data Insights: Visualizes important data such as top candidate skills, keywords, and more.
Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
The system is built using a combination of powerful technologies to provide accurate and efficient resume screening:

Python ‚Äì Primary programming language.
TensorFlow / Keras ‚Äì Used for AI and machine learning models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‚Äì Text analysis using NLP libraries such as spaCy and NLTK.
Flask / FastAPI ‚Äì Web framework for building APIs for integration with other systems.
Scikit-learn ‚Äì For traditional machine learning techniques like classification and ranking.
Installation üì¶
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sriharshini2022/AI-powered-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System.git
cd AI-powered-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the environment (make sure you have Python 3.x installed):

For local testing, you might want to use a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Or for FastAPI:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn app:app --reload
Navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port you specified) in your browser.

Usage üß™
Input
To use the system, you'll need to upload:

Job Description: A text file or document outlining the job role and requirements.
Resumes: Multiple resumes (in PDF, DOCX, or plain text format) of candidates.
Process
Upload the job description.
Upload resumes to the system.
The system will parse the resumes and compare each resume to the job description.
It will rank candidates based on the match between the resume content and the job description.
Output
Ranked Resume List: Candidates are ranked from the most relevant to the least relevant.
Match Scores: Each candidate will have a score indicating how well their resume matches the job description.
Visualizations: Graphs or charts to show the distribution of key skills and experience across all resumes.
Example üíª
Job Description
For example, if the job description is for a Data Scientist role, the system will highlight key skills like Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Statistics.

Sample Resume
John Doe's Resume might contain skills like Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning.

Result: The system ranks John Doe's resume highly if it matches the job description for the Data Scientist role based on skills and experience.
